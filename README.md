**What is a chatbot?**

Chatbots are computer programs that simulate human conversation, written or spoken. These days, chatbots are starting to integrate conversational AI, such as natural language processing (NLP), to understand questions even if it isn’t grammatically correct and then respond based on data it has collected.


A chatbot may prompt you to ask a question or describe a problem, to which it will either clarify what you said or provide a response. Some chatbots are simple, responding only to the question asked. Some are sophisticated, learning information about you based on data collected and evolving to better assist you over time.

**How do chatbots work?**

Chatbots process collected data and are often trained on that data using AI, machine learning (ML), NLP, and rules defined by the developer. This allows the chatbot to provide accurate and efficient responses to all requests. The two main types of chatbots are declarative chatbots and predictive chatbots.

**Types of chatbots**

Chatbot type is determined by its capabilities. Declarative chatbots are more basic than predictive chatbots.


**Declarative chatbots**

perform one function. These chatbots use NLP, defined rules, and ML to generate automated responses when you ask a question. Declarative, or task-oriented chatbots, are most common in customer support and service–and are best when answering commonly asked questions like what the store hours are and what item you’re returning. This type of chatbot is common, but its capabilities are a little basic compared to predictive chatbots.


**Predictive chatbots**

are more sophisticated and personalized than declarative chatbots. Often considered conversational chatbots, or virtual agents, these AI- and data-driven chatbots are much more interactive and aware. They utilize NLP and more complicated ML, along with natural language understanding (NLU) to continue learning about the user through predictive analytics and intelligence. Over time, they can even predict recommendations and anticipate your needs.
